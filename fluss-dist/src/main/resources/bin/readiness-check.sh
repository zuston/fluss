# Fluss Readiness Check Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# Two-step readiness probe for Kubernetes StatefulSet rolling upgrades:
#
#   Step 1 — Local TCP port check: verify this TabletServer process is alive
#            and has bound its RPC port. Fast, no external dependency.
#
#   Step 2 — Cluster health check: call the LOCAL TabletServer's Cluster
#            Health API (which forwards to the Coordinator over the internal
#            listener) and pass only if status is GREEN.
#            YELLOW/RED/UNKNOWN means recovery is incomplete — block the upgrade.
#
# Both steps must pass for the pod to be marked Ready.
#
# Exit codes (from ClusterHealthReadinessCheck.java):
#   0 = Ready (status GREEN)
#   1 = Not ready (status YELLOW, RED, UNKNOWN, or TabletServer unreachable)
#   2 = API unsupported (older server) → immediate TCP fallback (latched)
#
# Environment variables (set by helm template or container spec):
#   FLUSS_HOME                    - Fluss installation directory
#   READINESS_TIMEOUT_MS          - Timeout for Health API call (default: 5000)
#   READINESS_TCP_HOST            - TabletServer host the probe talks to. Defaults
#       to ${POD_IP} when set (the typical Kubernetes case where bind.listeners
#       binds the tablet's CLIENT endpoint to the pod IP rather than 0.0.0.0),
#       falling back to 127.0.0.1 otherwise. The probe always talks to the local
#       sidecar tablet, which forwards getClusterHealth to the Coordinator over
#       the internal listener — so the probe never needs to know the
#       Coordinator's address.
#   READINESS_TCP_PORT            - TabletServer client port (default: 9124).
#   READINESS_HEALTH_CHECK_AUTH   - Optional client auth configuration as
#       semicolon-separated key:value pairs (e.g.
#       client.security.protocol:SASL;client.sasl.mechanism:PLAIN). Required only
#       when the local client listener enforces SASL.
#   READINESS_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS - Maximum wall-clock seconds the
#       cluster health gate is allowed to keep this pod NotReady on first boot.
#       After this budget is exhausted the probe latches the TCP-only fast path
#       so a permanently-unrecoverable cluster cannot wedge a rolling upgrade.
#       Default: 1200 (20 minutes).

# K8s readinessProbe runs every periodSeconds FOREVER, not only during a
# rolling upgrade. The cluster health gate (Step 2 below) is meant to gate
# the FIRST readiness of a freshly created pod so that recovery finishes
# before traffic flows. Running it on every probe cycle is unsafe:
#
#   1. Coordinator pod briefly goes down (e.g. its own rolling restart).
#   2. ALL tablet-server probes call run_recovery_check at the same period,
#      all fail to reach Coordinator → all flip to NotReady simultaneously.
#   3. statefulset then rolls all tablet-servers together → cascade outage:
#         coordinator-server-0   0/2   Init:0/1
#         tablet-server-0/1/2    0/2   Init:0/1
#
# So once the cluster has been GREEN at least once in this pod's lifetime
# (FIRST_READY_MARKER present), we DROP to TCP-only. The marker lives in
# /tmp/fluss-readiness, which is wiped whenever the pod is recreated by an
# upgrade — so each freshly created pod will run the recovery gate exactly
# ONCE before flipping to the fast path.
