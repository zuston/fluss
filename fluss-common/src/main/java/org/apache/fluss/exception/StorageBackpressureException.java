/**
 * Thrown by a tablet server to reject writes when the underlying KV storage is close to, or already
 * under, RocksDB write pressure.
 *
 * <p>This is the second tier of the cooperative backpressure model: the first tier is the proactive
 * client-side throttle (driven by per-bucket pressure piggybacked on responses); once the storage
 * engine itself is about to enter internal write delay or rejects a no-slowdown write, the server
 * short-circuits the write and returns this retriable exception so that request processing threads
 * are not blocked by the storage engine's internal sleep.
 *
 * <p>Clients should retry after a backoff equal to the configured throttle ceiling.
